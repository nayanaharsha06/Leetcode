/*

You're rightâ€”this line might seem redundant at first glance because we are 
already updating max_path_sum with potential maximum values.
Purpose of return Math.max(left, right) + node.val;
While max_path_sum keeps track of the maximum path sum that could include 
paths crossing through the current node, the line return Math.max(left, right) + node.val; 
calculates the maximum sum of paths that extend downward from the current node. 
we are returning it to int pathSum
